\title{Daughter wavelets}
\usage{
wave_bases(wname = c("MORLET", "PAUL", "DOG"), k, scale, wparam)
}
\arguments{
\item{wname}{A string, equal to "MORLET", "PAUL" or "DOG".}

\item{k}{A vector with the Fourier frequencies at which to calculate the wavelet.}

\item{scales}{A vector with the wavelet scales.}

\item{wparam}{The corresponding nondimensional parameter for the wavelet function.}
}
\value{
A matrix of size length(scale) x length(k), \code{daughter},
containing the fourier transform of the daughter wavelets for the mother "wname",
for the given scales (one row for each scale).
}
\description{
This function computes the daughter wavelets for three different families: "MORLET", "DOG" and "PAUL"
(Derivatives of the Gaussian). It is a translation from the Matlab(R) function published by Torrence
and Compo following (Torrence & Compo, 1998).

This is an internal function used for the computation of the wavelet continuous
transform with the \code{cwt_wst} function
