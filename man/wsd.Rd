\arguments{
\item{signal1}{A vector containing the first signal.}

\item{signal2}{A vector containing the second signal (its length should be equal to
that of \code{signal1}).}

\item{dt}{Numeric. The time step of the signals.}

\item{scaleparam}{A vector of three elements with the minimum scale, the maximum scale
and the number of suboctaves per octave for constructing power 2 scales (following
Torrence and Compo 1998). If NULL, they are automatically constructed.}

\item{windowrad}{Integer. Time radius for the windows, measured in \code{dt}. By
default, it is set to \eqn{ceiling(length(signal1) / 20)}.}

\item{rdist}{Integer. Log-scale radius for the windows measured in suboctaves. By
default, it is set to \eqn{ceiling(length(scales) / 20)}.}

\item{delta_t}{Integer. Increment of time for the construction of windows central
times, measured in \code{dt}. By default, it is set to
\eqn{ceiling(length(signal1) / 256)}.}

\item{normalize}{String, equal to "NO", "ENERGY", "MAX" or "SCALE". If "ENERGY", signals are
divided by their respective energies. If "MAX", each signal is divided by the maximum
value attained by its scalogram. In these two cases, \code{energy_density} must be TRUE.
Finally, if "SCALE", each signal is divided by their scalogram value at scale
\code{refscale}.}

\item{refscale}{Numeric. The reference scale for \code{normalize}.}

\item{wname}{A string, equal to "MORLET", "DOG", "PAUL", "HAAR" or "HAAR2". The
difference between "HAAR" and "HAAR2" is that "HAAR2" is more accurate but slower.}

\item{wparam}{The corresponding nondimensional parameter for the wavelet function
(Morlet, DoG or Paul).}

\item{waverad}{Numeric. The radius of the wavelet used in the computations for the cone
of influence. If it is not specified, it is asumed to be \eqn{\sqrt{2}} for Morlet and DoG,
\eqn{1/\sqrt{2}} for Paul and 0.5 for Haar.}

\item{border_effects}{String, equal to "BE", "INNER", "PER" or "SYM",
which indicates how to manage the border effects which arise usually when a convolution
is performed on finite-lenght signals.
\itemize{
\item "BE": With border effects, padding time series with zeroes.
\item "INNER": Normalized inner scalogram with security margin adapted for each
different scale.
\item "PER": With border effects, using boundary wavelets (periodization of the
original time series).
\item "SYM": With border effects, using a symmetric catenation of the original time
series.
}}

\item{mc_nrand}{Integer. Number of Montecarlo simulations to be performed in order to
determine the 95\% and 5\% significance contours.}

\item{commutative}{Logical. If TRUE (default) the commutative windowed scalogram
difference. Otherwise a non-commutative (but simpler) version is computed (see Bolós et
al. 2017).}

\item{wscnoise}{Numeric in \eqn{[0,1]}. If a (windowed) scalogram takes values close to
zero, some problems may appear because we are considering relative differences.
Specifically, we can get high relative differences that in fact are not relevant, or
even divisions by zero.

  If we consider absolute differences this would not happen but, on the other hand,
  using absolute differences is not appropriate for scalogram values not close to zero.

  So, the parameter \code{wscnoise} stablishes a threshold for the scalogram values
  above which a relative difference is computed, and below which a difference
  proportional to the absolute difference is computed (the proportionality factor is
  determined by requiring continuity).

  Finally, \code{wscnoise} can be interpreted as the relative amplitude of the noise in
  the scalograms and is chosen in order to make a relative (\eqn{= 0}), absolute
  (\eqn{= 1}) or mix (in \eqn{(0,1)}) difference between scalograms. Default value is
  set to \eqn{0.02}.}

\item{compensation}{Numeric. It is an alternative to \code{wscnoise} for
preventing numerical errors or non-relevant high relative differences when scalogram
values are close to zero (see Bolós et al. 2017). It should be a non-negative
relatively small value.}

\item{energy_density}{Logical. If TRUE (default), divide the scalograms by the square
root of the scales for convert them into energy density. Note that it does not affect
the results if \code{wscnoise} \eqn{= 0}.}

\item{parallel}{Logical. If TRUE, it uses function \code{parApply} from package
\code{parallel} for the Montecarlo simulations. When FALSE (default) it uses the normal
\code{apply} function.}

\item{makefigure}{Logical. If TRUE (default), a figure with the WSD is plotted.}

\item{time_values}{A numerical vector of length \code{length(signal)} containing custom
time values for the figure. If NULL (default), it will be computed starting at 0.}

\item{figureperiod}{Logical. If TRUE (default), periods are used in the figure instead
of scales.}

\item{xlab}{A string giving a custom X axis label.}

\item{ylab}{A string giving a custom Y axis label. If NULL (default) the Y label is
either "Scale" or "Period" depending on the value of \code{figureperiod}.}

\item{main}{A string giving a custom main title for the figure.}
}

the 95\% significance.
\item \code{signif05}: A logical matrix of size \code{length(tcentral)} x
